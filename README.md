# Cargo
Below is a comprehensive and detailed list of commands and techniques for `cargo`, the Rust package manager and build system. 

### **Cargo CLI Commands and Techniques**

#### **1. Basic Commands**

- **Initialize a new Cargo project:**
  ```bash
  cargo new project_name
  ```

- **Initialize a new Cargo project in an existing directory:**
  ```bash
  cargo init
  ```

- **Build a project:**
  ```bash
  cargo build
  ```

- **Build a project with optimizations (release mode):**
  ```bash
  cargo build --release
  ```

- **Run the project:**
  ```bash
  cargo run
  ```

- **Run tests:**
  ```bash
  cargo test
  ```

- **Check the code for errors without building:**
  ```bash
  cargo check
  ```

- **Update dependencies to the latest versions allowed by `Cargo.toml`:**
  ```bash
  cargo update
  ```

- **Clean the target directory:**
  ```bash
  cargo clean
  ```

- **Package the project into a distributable package:**
  ```bash
  cargo package
  ```

- **Publish a package to crates.io:**
  ```bash
  cargo publish
  ```

- **List available subcommands and options:**
  ```bash
  cargo --help
  ```

#### **2. Advanced Commands**

- **Build and run with custom features:**
  ```bash
  cargo build --features "feature_name"
  cargo run --features "feature_name"
  ```

- **Cross-compile for a different target:**
  ```bash
  cargo build --target target_triple
  ```

- **Run a specific test:**
  ```bash
  cargo test test_name
  ```

- **Generate a new Rust binary crate:**
  ```bash
  cargo new binary_crate --bin
  ```

- **Generate a new Rust library crate:**
  ```bash
  cargo new library_crate --lib
  ```

- **Show detailed information about a package:**
  ```bash
  cargo show package_name
  ```

- **List all dependencies:**
  ```bash
  cargo tree
  ```

- **Check code for common errors (with `clippy`):**
  ```bash
  cargo clippy
  ```

- **Format code according to style guidelines (with `rustfmt`):**
  ```bash
  cargo fmt
  ```

- **Run a specific binary from a package:**
  ```bash
  cargo run --bin binary_name
  ```

- **Run a specific example from a package:**
  ```bash
  cargo run --example example_name
  ```

- **Build documentation:**
  ```bash
  cargo doc
  ```

- **Open the documentation in a web browser:**
  ```bash
  cargo doc --open
  ```

#### **3. Working with Workspaces**

- **Create a new workspace:**
  ```bash
  cargo new workspace_name --vcs none
  ```

- **Add a new package to a workspace:**
  ```bash
  cargo new package_name --lib
  ```

- **Build all packages in a workspace:**
  ```bash
  cargo build --workspace
  ```

- **Run tests for all packages in a workspace:**
  ```bash
  cargo test --workspace
  ```

- **Clean all packages in a workspace:**
  ```bash
  cargo clean --workspace
  ```

#### **4. Dependency Management**

- **Add a dependency to the `Cargo.toml` file:**
  ```bash
  cargo add dependency_name
  ```

- **Remove a dependency from the `Cargo.toml` file:**
  ```bash
  cargo rm dependency_name
  ```

- **Update all dependencies to the latest versions:**
  ```bash
  cargo update
  ```

- **List outdated dependencies:**
  ```bash
  cargo outdated
  ```

#### **5. Cargo Configuration**

- **Show the current configuration:**
  ```bash
  cargo config --list
  ```

- **Set configuration options for Cargo:**
  ```bash
  cargo config --set key=value
  ```

- **Reset Cargo configuration to default:**
  ```bash
  cargo config --reset
  ```

#### **6. Building for Different Targets**

- **Build for a different architecture or operating system:**
  ```bash
  cargo build --target target_triple
  ```

- **Specify a custom target directory:**
  ```bash
  cargo build --target-dir /path/to/dir
  ```

#### **7. Profiling and Benchmarking**

- **Profile a build with `perf`:**
  ```bash
  cargo build --release
  perf record --call-graph dwarf cargo run
  perf report
  ```

- **Benchmark code using `criterion`:**
  ```bash
  cargo add criterion
  ```

- **Write and run benchmarks:**
  ```rust
  #[bench]
  fn my_benchmark(b: &mut Bencher) {
      b.iter(|| { /* code to benchmark */ });
  }
  ```

  ```bash
  cargo bench
  ```

#### **8. Working with Custom Commands**

- **Define custom Cargo commands using plugins:**
  ```rust
  [package]
  name = "my_package"
  version = "0.1.0"

  [dependencies]
  cargo = "1.0"
  ```

- **Install and use Cargo plugins:**
  ```bash
  cargo install cargo-edit
  cargo install cargo-metadata
  ```

- **List installed Cargo plugins:**
  ```bash
  cargo install --list
  ```

### **Conclusion**
